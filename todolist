create the binaries.

some missing small lines, the quality of the small lines, change the size of the window, the thresholding at the begining?

1. get the center point x by clustering ( 1 cluster)
2. use a window of size 10 pixels
3. use the whole height or ( end point max y of lines)? height or original height
4. create the binaries_image ( fence mask) and recording
5. apply PCL
6. ask taylor for waypoints.
